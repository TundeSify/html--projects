    <p>
      The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew,
      or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate
      crew that originated from the East Blue. They are the main focus and
      protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main
      protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to
      him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat
      Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going
      Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc.
      During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship,
      which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members
      fought over different names.

      Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were
      separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea
      and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they
      trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake
      of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a
      dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the
      Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of
      Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four
      Emperors.
