      <p>
        The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew,
        or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate
        crew that originated from the East Blue. They are the main focus and
        protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main
        protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to
        him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat
        Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going
        Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc.
        During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship,
        which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members
        fought over different names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were
        separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea
        and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they
        trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake
        of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a
        dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the
        Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of
        Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four
        Emperors.
