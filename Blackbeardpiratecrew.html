        <p>
          Marshall D. Teach, most commonly referred to by his epithet
          "Blackbeard", is the captain-turned-admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates,
          and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. He is also
          the only known person in history to wield the powers of two Devil
          Fruits, as well as being part of a special bloodline, which is only
          known to a small number of individuals, including his own crew and the
          Five Elders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teach started out his pirate career as an apprentice of the Whitebeard
          Pirates, then later became a member of the crew's 2nd Division.
          However, he murdered Thatch, the 4th Division Commander, in order to
          steal the Yami Yami no Mi, a rare darkness-based Logia Devil Fruit
          with the power to nullify the Devil Fruit abilities of others. He then
          fled from Whitebeard's crew and, after defeating the infamous 2nd
          Division Commander Portgas D. Ace and handing him over to the Marines,
          was awarded a position among the Seven Warlords of the Sea. He only
          held the position briefly, though, using it to infiltrate the great
          underwater prison Impel Down and escaping with multiple infamous Level
          6 prisoners recruited into his crew. Upon arriving at the Summit War
          of Marineford, he resigned from his position and murdered Whitebeard,
          mysteriously stealing his quake-generating power. This, along with his
          victory in the Payback War and conquest of the majority of
          Whitebeard's territories during the timeskip, resulted in his
          acknowledgement as one of the Four Emperors, as well as him being
          considered a part of the "Worst Generation" along with the eleven
          Supernovas. After the Rocky Port Incident, he turned the island of
          Hachinosu into his base of operations with the ambition of having it
          officially accepted into the World Government as the Blackbeard
          Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teach initially had no bounty; however, after resigning from the Seven
          Warlords, recruiting several dangerous criminals to his crew from
          Impel Down, and becoming one of the Four Emperors, he received a
          bounty of Beli2,247,600,000. Following the downfalls of Kaidou and Big
          Mom during the Wano Country Arc, his bounty was increased to
          Beli3,996,000,000 for unknown reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his actions throughout the series, namely his key role in the
          deaths of Portgas D. Ace and Whitebeard, Teach consistently serves as
          one of the primary antagonists of the entire series. During the
          series' first half, he is an unseen minor antagonist in the Drum
          Island Arc, a minor antagonist in the Jaya Arc, the secondary
          antagonist of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, and one of the main
          antagonists of the Summit War Saga (specifically, the secondary
          antagonist of the Impel Down Arc and one of the three primary
          antagonists in the Marineford Arc). During the series' second half, he
          is a minor antagonist in the Dressrosa Arc, a supporting antagonist in
          the Egghead Arc and serves as one of the overarching main antagonists
          in the Final Saga.
