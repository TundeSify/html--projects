      <h2><a href="Beastpiratecrew.html">Beast Pirates Crew</a></h2>
      <p>
        The Beasts Pirates are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led
        by their governor-general, Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors. They
        were based in Wano Country, specifically headquartered on Onigashima.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 26 years, the Beast Pirates consolidated their power in Wano,
        which they occupied through an alliance with the country's shogun,
        Kurozumi Orochi. Within the past four years, the crew partnered with
        Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown to create artificial Zoan Devil
        Fruits called SMILE Fruits, leading to the crew having over 500 users with
        Devil Fruit powers. After the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance captured
        Caesar, destroyed the SMILE Factory and defeated Doflamingo, Kaidou turned
        to a new alliance with the Big Mom Pirates. The two Emperors' alliance
        planned to conquer the world by obtaining the Ancient Weapons and the One
        Piece. Part of this plan is Kaidou's "New Onigashima Project", which
        sought to replace Orochi as shogun with Yamato during the latest Fire
        Festival. This scheme ultimately failed, as during the Raid on Onigashima,
        all their top officers, alongside his fellow Emperor Big Mom, were
        defeated one after another by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance and
        Kaidou himself was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat
        Pirates. After the battle, Kaidou was sent flying down into an underground
        magma chamber and was caught in a massive volcanic explosion, while the
        fates of the remaining members are unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, Kaidou was no longer considered as one of the Four Emperors
        following the announcement of his defeat, leaving the overall status of
        the Beasts Pirates unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to their actions and role, they are the main antagonists of the Zou
        Arc and Wano Country Arc, and one of the central antagonist groups of the
        Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga.
