      <h1>Devil Fruits</h1>

      <p>
        Devil Fruits are supernatural fruits that are scattered throughout the
        world. Any living being who eats one will gain a unique ability at the
        cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the
        ability to swim. With one notable exception, beings are limited to
        acquiring one Devil Fruit power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devil Fruits are classified into three types: Paramecia fruits grant a
        vast array of generally "superhuman" abilities; Zoan fruits grant the
        power to transform into animals; and Logia fruits, the rarest and most
        powerful, grant the power to transform one's body into a natural element.
        Each fruit is also given a name based on the power it grants and has a
        unique appearance, which can be used to identify it. One fruit, in
        particular, has the honor of having two names and being identified with
        two types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devil Fruits are very rare in the world, enough to be considered myths in
        many corners of the world, but they are much more common in the Grand Line
        and have been consumed by many prominent figures among the Three Great
        Powers. The abilities they bestow coupled with their rarity cause Devil
        Fruits to be highly sought-after; single specimens may be valued at up to
        several billion belly, and extensive efforts have been made to replicate
        their powers and mass-produce artificial versions for warfare. The
        scientist Dr. Vegapunk has performed the most extensive research into
        Devil Fruits and has achieved numerous unnatural applications and
        replications of their abilities, but not even he knows for certain how
        Devil Fruits originated.

              <h1>Devil Fruit Types:</h1>
                  <p>
                    There are three basic types (系, kei?, also transl. as "systems/series")
                    that all Devil Fruits are categorized into based on the nature of the
                    powers they grant. Those types are Logia, Zoan, and Paramecia.
                  </p>
            </div>
            <br>
        <div class="second">
          <h2>Paramecia</h2>
              <p>
                The most common Devil Fruit type, Paramecia, encompasses fruits that grant
                any one of a wide variety of "superhuman" abilities. Their one unifying
                characteristic is that they are anything other than the ability to
                transform into animals or into elements of nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some Paramecia fruits allow one to transform oneself or adopt a special
                bodily trait, temporarily or permanently (e.g., gaining a slippery
                physique, a body that can split into pieces harmlessly, a diamond body,
                becoming a jacket to be worn by others, transforming into blades and other
                weapons, controlling one's weight, mimicking appearances, gaining
                clairvoyant eyes or a brain with infinite storage capacity, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Other abilities involve creating substances from nothing, some of which
                may have strange properties (e.g., wax as hard as steel, soap that can
                "clean off" strength, poison, strings that can control people like
                puppets, straw with "voodoo" properties, etc.). Other fruits' powers
                involve creating and manipulating intangible forces (like "quake"
                shockwaves, gravity, or heat) and yet other abilities involve summoning
                discrete objects or entities (e.g., copies of one's own body parts,
                ghosts, a "genie" familiar, articles of clothing, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Other Paramecia powers allow wielders to influence and alter their
                environment, both living beings (sometimes including their own self)
                and/or objects (e.g., turning people into toys, controlling people's
                shadows or souls, "taming" animals, controlling specific objects like
                books or mirrors, making things levitate, making projectiles auto-lock
                onto targets, "surgically" modifying anything within one's domain, etc.).
              </p>
        </div>

            <div class="second">
              <h2>Zoan</h2>
                  <p>
                    Zoan-type Devil Fruits grant the power to transform into a specific
                    animal, as well as transform into a hybrid form between the ability user's
                    own species (most frequently human) and the aforesaid animal. Unlike other
                    Devil Fruits, Zoan fruits are said to carry a will of their own. A
                    recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into
                    inanimate objects, bringing the object to life and granting it the
                    standard Zoan transformations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zoan transformations greatly enhance a user's physical abilities and are
                    the best kind of power for augmenting melee combat, with Carnivorous
                    animal Zoans being especially well-suited for combat due to their
                    predatory attributes (claws, fangs, etc.). Some Zoans grant special
                    abilities based on the animal, like avian Zoans granting the ability of
                    flight, the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit globs of poison, or
                    the mole Zoan allowing the user to dig through the earth, even through
                    solid stone, at high speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aside from most Zoans that transform users into animals that currently
                    exist, there are three known sub-classifications:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Ancient - Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into an extinct
                      species, such as dinosaurs. Ancient Zoans are rare, and they appear to
                      be stronger than regular Zoans. Some have even displayed atypical
                      physical abilities that their users claim the real animals naturally
                      possessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Mythical - Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into
                      mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan
                      animals tend to have additional special powers, like a phoenix Zoan
                      being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical Zoans
                      are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even more so than Logias.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Artificial - Artificially created Zoan Fruits that cause the user to
                      permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely,
                      the user becomes able to transform at will. The artificial Zoan Fruits
                      had a 10% success rate, while the other 90%, in addition to not gaining
                      animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the
                      ability to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile
                      and laugh, regardless of how they actually feel. These artificial Devil
                      Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and Donquixote
                      Doflamingo. Another version was developed by Vegapunk.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </div>
        <br />
        <div class="second">
          <h2>Logia</h2>
              <p>
                Logia, the rarest and most powerful of the three basic Devil Fruit types,
                refers to fruits that grant the power to create, control, and transform
                one's body into an element of nature, e.g.: fire, lightning, ice, sand,
                mud, magma, smoke, gas, plants, light, and darkness.
              </p>
              <p>
                When transforming into their element, a Logia user becomes physically
                invulnerable (or outright intangible in the case of certain elements) and
                retains control over their body even if separated into pieces. A Logia
                user may also gain ancillary powers conceptually tied to their element,
                such as the sand Logia's power to dry things, the light Logia's ability to
                travel at light speed, the gas Logia's power to control the atmosphere, or
                the darkness Logia's power to nullify other Devil Fruit abilities on
                contact. The darkness Logia, in particular, stands out for its element
                being more esoteric compared to other Logias, representing not the mere
                absence of light but, rather, the all-consuming "darkness" of black holes.
                Some Logia powers even create a seemingly infinite space inside the user's
                elemental form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some few Logias that are considered non-canon grant the ability to become
                an artificial "element" like paper or candy syrup, although no such fruit
                has been introduced in the manga.

              <h1>Awakening</h1>
                  <p>
                    "Listen closely, boy. There is another stage entirely to the powers of a
                    Devil Fruit: awakening!!! It's very rare, but some powers can awaken and
                    affect objects aside from the wielder!!!"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Devil Fruit powers can, in rare instances, achieve "Awakening" (覚醒,
                    kakusei?), significantly increasing the user's abilities. According to
                    Kaidou, awakening occurs when a Devil Fruit user's mind and body catch up
                    to their powers. When a Devil Fruit's power is awakened, the increased
                    abilities have been seen to allow significantly greater power, more
                    refined control, and new abilities that would otherwise not be possible.
                    The effects of the awakening depend on the type of Devil Fruit. Awakening
                    was first mentioned by Crocodile in Episode 447.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has been noted that it takes time to fully master awakened powers; if
                    they are not fully mastered, they can still be used, but they take a
                    serious toll on the user's stamina.
