        <h2>Kaidou</h2>
        <img src="IMG/white.jpg" alt=""> <img src="IMG/13.gif" alt="13" />
        <p>
          Kaidou of the Beasts, renowned as the world's "Strongest Creature", is
          the Governor-General of the Beasts Pirates and was formerly one of the
          Four Emperors that ruled over the New World. He is also the father of
          Yamato.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a promising child soldier at the service of the Vodka Kingdom
          decades ago, Kaidou was drafted against his will by the Marines but
          managed to escape and start a career in piracy. He was invited by
          Edward Newgate to join the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice,
          where he met and befriended Charlotte Linlin. During the God Valley
          Incident when the Rocks Pirates met their downfall, Linlin provided
          Kaidou with the rare Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Uo Uo no Mi,
          Model: Seiryu. He then went on to form his own crew and build it up
          into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World
          Government.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being invited to Wano Country by Kurozumi Higurashi, Kaidou
          joined forces with Wano Country's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi, and
          occupied Onigashima as his base. After a failed attempt by Kouzuki
          Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards to overthrow him, he continued to
          accrue military might in Wano for 20 years before deciding to dispose
          of Orochi and proceed with his plan for the New Onigashima Project.
          Forming a Pirate Alliance with Big Mom, Kaidou intended to seize the
          Ancient Weapons and claim the One Piece. The plan never came to
          fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the
          Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and the
          Beasts Pirates were ultimately defeated. Following Kaidou's defeat at
          Monkey D. Luffy's hands, the World Economy News Paper released a new
          listing of the Four Emperors, with Kaidou no longer being included
          among them anymore. After his defeat, Kaidou is now referred to in
          Wano's folklore retelling as "Dragon King Kaidou" (龍王カイドウ, Ryūō
          Kaidō?)
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaidou was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby
          Arc when he revealed the existence of the Four Emperors, and was then
          first directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc, with
          his status as one of the Four Emperors revealed after the Straw Hat
          Pirates defeated Moria. Thus, Kaidou is the third Emperor mentioned by
          name and the last to debut. Before he debuted in person, his voice was
          heard in a flashback that Kouzuki Momonosuke had when first
          disembarking on Dressrosa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his actions, he can be considered the overarching antagonist of
          the Dressrosa Saga, the main antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and
          Saga, and a major antagonist of the second half of the series.

        <p>
          "Red Flag" X Drake (pronounced as "Diez Drake") is the captain of the
          Marine Secret Special Unit SWORD. In order to go undercover as a
          pirate, he publicly defected from his position as rear admiral and
          founded the Drake Pirates. He is one of twelve pirates referred to as
          the "Worst Generation", and before the two-year timeskip had a bounty
          of Beli222,000,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drake is the son of the Marine-turned-pirate Diez Barrels, and was
          affiliated with the Barrels Pirates until he defected to the Marines.
          As a young adult, he was called Dory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Drake's endeavor as an undercover spy, he and his crew became
          subordinate to the Beasts Pirates, led by Kaidou of the Four Emperors,
          over the two-year timeskip. Drake served as one of the crew's
          Shinuchi, specifically one of strongest six called Tobiroppo. His
          treachery was eventually uncovered, however, leading him to ally
          himself with the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance.
