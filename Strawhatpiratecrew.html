            <h2>Monkey D. Luffy</h2>
             <img src="IMG/2.gif" alt="2" draggable="false"/>
            <p>
              Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw
              Hat", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the
              increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly
              pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to
              become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream
              (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes
              that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey
              D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such
              is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp
              and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood
              to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and "Flame Emperor" Sabo.
              However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate
              "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil
              Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his
              life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to
              reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national,
              and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue
              pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea,
              Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New
              World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has
              triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and
              indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the
              impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the
              Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor
              in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for
              attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging
              every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among
              many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several
              Marines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage,
              and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the
              focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and
              Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a
              central member of the Worst Generation, the unwilling leader of the
              seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and in wake of defeating Kaidou
              during the Raid on Onigashima one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty
              of Beli3,000,000,000. Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after
              centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of
              JoyBoy.

          <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>
          <img src="IMG/3.gif" alt="3" draggable="false"/>
          <p>
            Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant
            of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the
            Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly
            recognized as the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain
            Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of
            Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn
            Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the
            grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew
            of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki
            Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As
            a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created
            during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of
            the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy
            and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to
            become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a
            promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin
            Kuina.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
            bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody
            Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the
            eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red
            Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit
            War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go
            on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."
          </p>
          <p>
            Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc.
            It later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident,
            then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the
            Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.

          <p>
            "Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw
            Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
            Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join,
            doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus,
            making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his
            family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as
            an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually
            entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he
            would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join
            his crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is
            where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along
            with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw
            Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the "Monster
            Trio".
          </p>
          <p>
            He first gained a bounty of Beli77,000,000 for his role in the raid on
            Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc,
            but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his
            biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's
            territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive
            (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it), and its value
            increased to Beli330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his
            bounty was increased to Beli1,032,000,000.

          <p>
            "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and
            one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the
            tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the
            Wano Country Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man
            Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's
            dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He
            was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second
            captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He
            eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he
            resigned during the Summit War of Marineford. Vegapunk later cloned
            Jinbe as one of the Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and
            two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New
            Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune
            Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat
            Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during
            the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to
            protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the
            Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his
            status as a member of the crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            He first gained a bounty of Beli76,000,000 due to him being a member
            of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to Beli250,000,000 after
            Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen
            after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a
            Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at
            Beli438,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was
            increased to Beli1,100,000,000.

            "God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the
            Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fourth member
            of the crew and the third to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup
            Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he
            rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usopp is the son of Yasopp and the late Banchina. He was born and
            raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and
            being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat
            Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew.
            Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior
            of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of
            living up to this dream.
          </p>

            He first gained a bounty of Beli30,000,000 under his Sogeking Persona
            after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp
            gained a bounty of Beli200,000,000 under his own name. Following the
            Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli500,000,000.

            Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the "Light of
            the Revolution", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one
            of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the
            seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end
            of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7
            Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico
            Olvia. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the
            power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface
            at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara,
            she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the
            ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered
            forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
          </p>
          <p>
            She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday",
            serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's
            president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename
            "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before
            joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which
            tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
          </p>
          <p>
            She gained a bounty of Beli79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her
            ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later
            increased to Beli80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby
            to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to

          <p>
            Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the
            doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the
            Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the sixth member of the crew and the
            fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc. He was
            temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long
            Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that
            allows its user to transform into a human hybrid at will. He was
            taught medicine on Drum Island by his two parental figures, Doctors
            Hiriluk and Kureha. Chopper aims to travel all across the world in the
            hopes of accomplishing his dream of being able to cure any disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chopper gained his first bounty of Beli50 after the incident at Enies
            Lobby, having been mistaken for the Straw Hats' pet. After the
            Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli100, then to Beli1,000
            following the Raid on Onigashima.

          <h2>Brook</h2>
           <img src="IMG/10.gif" alt="10" draggable="false"/>
          <p>
            "Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
            their two swordsmen, and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat
            Grand Fleet. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to
            join, doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life
            after death once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the
            powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own
            soul and the souls of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected
            through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount
            of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a
            skeleton, keeping only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the
            Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as
            the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially
            joining the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon,
            at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
          </p>
          <p>
            He first gained a bounty of Beli33,000,000 during his time as a member
            of the Rumbar Pirates. It later increased to Beli83,000,000 after the
            Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was
            increased to Beli383,000,000.

          <h2>Franky</h2>
           <img src="IMG/11.gif" alt="11" draggable="false"/>
          <p>
            "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one
            of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's
            eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the
            Post-Enies Lobby Arc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until
            eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of
            Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South Blue, Franky
            was abandoned by his family as a ten-year-old, eventually making his
            way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until
            an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring
            him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he
            became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers
            and bounty hunters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at
            the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to
            become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Due
            to this, he is the secondary antagonist of the first half of the Water
            7 Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world
            with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat
            Pirates to fulfill his dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            He gained a bounty of Beli44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies
            Lobby Incident. It later increased to Beli94,000,000 after the
            Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was
            increased to Beli394,000,000.
