            <h4>Chapter 1128: "RPG"</h4>
              <p>
                In One Piece Chapter 1128, titled "RPG," the Straw Hats continue their adventure in a mysterious land that was initially mistaken for Elbaf. They discover that they are actually in the "Land of Gods," a place ruled by mythological deities, such as the Spike God and the Sun God. The chapter reveals that the island the crew is on is made of LEGO-like blocks. As Luffy and the others explore, they encounter two beasts inspired by Norse mythology: Hilmungandr, a snake-like creature, and Muginn, a raven. Luffy, in Gear 5 mode, defeats Hilmungandr, while Zoro takes down Muginn. The crew then flees as the mysterious Sun God—depicted wearing a deer skull—chases them. The chapter ends with the Straw Hats navigating their way through a diorama-like world as they try to escape, with the Sun God in pursuit.
