          <h4>Chapter 1127: "Adventure in the Land of Mystery"</h4>
    <p>
      In One Piece Chapter 1127, titled "Adventure in the Mysterious Kingdom," the story continues in Elbaf after some of the Straw Hats were separated in the previous chapter. Nami finds herself in a mysterious Lego-like castle, where she encounters strange creatures, including giant insects and a colossal hedgehog. She eventually reunites with Usopp, who is battling a massive cat. The duo is chased by these creatures until Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro arrive to assist, clad in Viking outfits. The trio launches powerful attacks to protect their crewmates. During this chaos, Nami expresses her confusion and fear, while the others act more casually, even discussing their recent battle with giant bees and enjoying roasted rabbit. The chapter builds excitement for the ongoing Elbaf arc as the Straw Hats prepare to regroup and escape the castle, though the whereabouts of Chopper and other crew members remain unclearâ€‹
